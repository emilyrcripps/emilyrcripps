# Re-Imagined Suffragette Poster

The Suffrage movement, although was not the first to shed light on the inequality women faced at the time, was the most notable of the time. This movement along with the womenâ€™s resilience during the WWI war effort helped women achieve the vote in 1928 (in England).

Having researched Suffragette pamphlets from the time I re-imagined a front and back cover. 

Adding the synonymous colours of purple, white and green and the iconic call to action to make it more recognisable. I have also added the texture of crumpled and ripped paper to give a sense of age and history.
