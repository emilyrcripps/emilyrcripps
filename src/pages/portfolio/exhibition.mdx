# Niki de Saint Phalle Exhibition

Saint Phalle was arguably one of the most avant-garde sculptors of our time. Her dedication to showcasing feminism and the female form cements her status in the modern world which continues to inspire and delight. 

This imaginary exhibition housed at the Tate Modern takes inspiration from, and focusses on, Saint Phalleâ€™s world-renowned Nana sculptures.

As part of this visual system I created a colour scheme, logotype, visual assets, promotional materials and informative ephemera, merchandise and a way-finding system. A selection of which can be found below.
