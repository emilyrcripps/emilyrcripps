# Giraffe About Town

“Get ready to look up! Edinburgh Zoo is working with creative producers Wild in Art to present Giraffe About Town – a large-scale public art event in Edinburgh in the summer of 2022.

Designed to celebrate Edinburgh’s extraordinary heritage and cultural diversity, our giraffes will be displayed for two months in locations across the capital, highlighting iconic spots and hidden gems from Edinburgh Airport to Leith.” - Giraffe About Town

My Giraffe design, sponsored by Expert Sleepers, will be hitting the streets of Edinburgh in July 2022!
