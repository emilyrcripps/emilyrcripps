# Glyph Illustration - Bees

In the last 80 years, 97% of our wild-flower habitats have disappeared which has led to the decline of the UKâ€™s bumblebee population.

In this 1 week mini-project I was asked to create an informative GIF, highlighting the plight of the nations bumblebee population.

As part of this task I created these bee illustrations using several glyphs in various weights from the typeface Inter.
