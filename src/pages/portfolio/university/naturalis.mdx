# Naturalis

Naturalis has been created from the perspicuous shapes of extinct and endangered animals. This distinct font aims to bring life back to these creatures through its playful curvature and versatility.

This 12 week project started with a visit to the Oxford Natural History museum where I collected photographs of specimens that interested me. After the trip I decided to highlight how many animals are either extinct or on the brink through the creation of this font and subsequent type specimen book.

This hand-bound type-specimen book consists of 9 glyphs, showcased in a variety of forms, each bookmarked with a lasercut page inspired by the texture of the corresponding specimen.
