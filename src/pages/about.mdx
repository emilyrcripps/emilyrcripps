## About Me

After a horrendous 5 year foray into an accountancy career, the only respite being adventurous holidays and theatre trips, I decided enough was enough and I need to do something I loved...Enter the world of Graphic Design. Since then I have enrolled onto a Graphic Design degree at Oxford Brookes and not looked back since. 

With influences such as Tim Burton, Annie Atkins, Lin-Manuel Miranda and MinaLima it’s not a surprise that I find myself drawn to the world of Film, TV and Theatre.

When I’m not designing I can be found hanging upside down in an aerial hoop, reading or cooing over animals great and small.

For a more in-depth look at my passions, take a look at the illustration above.
