# Contact Me

Graphic Designer & Illustrator based in Oxford. My skills lie in Graphic Design for film, television, theatre and prop making although I find myself constantly experimenting in various fields. 

I am an avid musical theatre fan and am guaranteed to be rocking out to show tunes whilst designing...it’s cooler than it sounds...When I’m not designing I can be found hanging upside down in an aerial hoop, reading or cooing over animals great and small.

If you are interested in my work, please contact me. I am always looking for exciting new opportunities.
