# Contact Me

Emily is a multi-disciplined graphic designer focussing in the field Graphic Design for film, television, theatre and prop making although is constantly experimenting in various fields.

Emily’s work has been showcased around Edinburgh during their ‘Giraffe About Town’ 2022 event, had group work shortlisted for the Creative Conscious Design Award 2022 and has had work exhibited at the ‘Note to Self’ exhibition hosted by Glimpse in 2023.

An avid musical theatre fan, she is guaranteed to be rocking out to show tunes whilst designing...it’s cooler than it sounds. When not designing, Emily can be found hanging upside down from an aerial hoop, reading or cooing over animals great and small.
